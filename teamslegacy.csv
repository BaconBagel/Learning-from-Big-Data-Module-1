in7cu5t,:red-bull: Red Bull,"Max was in the lead the entire race. He was like 10 seconds clear of Lewis before his first pit stop, and then barely behind the two Mercedes when they made their first pit stop. After that they gained some ground on him of course, being on fresher tyres, but Max was always ""virtually"" in the lead. Without safety cars however he would have had to overtake both Mercedes cars near the end of the race, with fresh softs or mediums against them on used hards. Would have been an interesting finish of the race, but he probably would have been able to do it.

After the VSC he was on new hards ahead of the Mercedes on new mediums. The hards weren't working very well on that Red Bull, but he had a comfortable lead and the hard would have degraded less towards the end of the race, so very unlikely the Mercedeses would have been able to challenge him.

After the 2nd SC it was all over of course.

Each safety car slightly benefited Max, but he was always in control of the race.",28,1662396848

And if you would've told me five years ago, that there would be fanfiction about Leclerc and his sexual activities, I would ask you if you've gone mad.

But this is a part of the new following in F1. The focus is in large parts on looks, personality, and the fame & glamour. Not the car, not the driving, not about achievements, but more of what they say, how they look, and what they post to Instagram.",11,1662403090

in7x4oe,:ferrari: Ferrari,"""Carguys"" (or lets say ""carperson"") and Formula 1 have always gone hand in hand. F1 as the pinnacle of innovation, the pinnacle of speed. With casual fans, often neither interested in cars/motoring or the technical/scientific bit, many start to be interested in other stuff surrounding the sport.

So getting all the history about and around F1, then trying to understand the technical stuff. It is A LOT to take in. A good comparison is Top Gear. A show that was loved by carpeople, but also the casual viewer that just wanted a laugh.

So a lot of the newer fans will rather start on a more personal and human level I think, which meshes perfectly with social media. Instagram with all the pictures and videos, Twitter with all the thoughts and meme stuff. So rather than understanding the cars, they go for the people. Personalities, looks, and the fame surrounding.

The problem I have with it is that I think F1 should be about the vehicles and the teams. Politics, personal opinions, and too much exposure just doesn't do this sport any good.",4,1662405086

Barrichello and Massa were second drivers, not so fast as real champions (Schumacher, Hamilton, Verstappen). They can’t compete with superior drivers at their times. Massa got unlucky, but honestly he didn’t deserve that title in 2008, Hamilton was stronger and it has always been. 


Alonso is a team killer, as in McLaren he is the First Lady, he broke the teams, he broke the unity; think that he didn’t share his data with Massa who is a real second driver. He is not a team player, but formula 1 is also about sharing data and helping the team to build a better car. You can’t be like “give me a fast car” without giving your contribution for it. The driver is the first source of informations for engineering. For example Vettel was absolutely superior in this matter compared to Alonso.


Vettel screwed himself many times under pressure, he showed that he won with a clear stronger car with zero competitors and he was simply not at the level of Hamilton; Lewis Hamilton or Max Verstappen would have won with 2018 Ferrari, be honest.

in639oa,:ferrari: Ferrari,"As you said nobody is infallible its part of being human but Newey has got it right more times than he gotten it wrong with the MP4/18 being one of those rare occasions where the car was fast but unreliable mainly due to packaging. 

Ferrari failed to capitalise on the advantage they had in the first half of the season where they did indeed have the edge over Redbull but the Redbull has been the class of the field now for quite a few races in the second half of the season and Ferrari has fallen behind even Mercedes.

I don't think you can say that Ferrari is still the better car at this moment in time, they still bounce/porpoise something Redbull hasn't done since the early races. The Redbull is able to generate immense downforce while being aerodynamically efficient and fast as a bullet on a straight line something no other team has been able to do. They also suffer less dyre deg than other teams while still being fast (combination of car and driver I suspect) you can see Max is able to maintain his lap times while also going longer into a stint before needing to change tyres. 

Their car is perfectly balanced and fast on the majority of the tracks including ones like the Dutch GP which clearly isn't tailored to their design but the team and Max can get it to work there. On high speed circuits they are utterly dominant examples being Spa and I expect the same will happen in Monza next week. 

Honestly I would always bet on Newey during a regulation change even in 2014 the Redbull chassis was fantastic let down by the underpowered unreliable Renault engine.",19,1662374308

Do I think that alonso, rosberg and button are better drivers than probably all of max's teammates?

 In silverstone I felt lewis was really unlucky that he didnt get the win because the safety car Imo was arguably worse for him than yesterday's, I felt that In silverstone he was going for the win, yesterday my money would be on max If no bottas and and yuki happened.

A frustrated Dutch fan throws a flare on to the circuit in hopes of causing a red flag, which would benefit Verstappen. The flare ends up in the middle of the circuit, causing the race leaders to red flag the race. But Max Verstappen is not able to spot the flare in time and drives over it, causing him to retire. Charles Leclerc takes Pole Position for the restart but has a bad reaction time. Lewis Hamilton passes him before turn 1 and George Russell manages to find a way past too. Sergio Perez tries to sneak his way up to third into turn 3 but locks up and goes straight into the barriers. Hamilton wins with Russell completing the Mercedes 1-2. Leclerc round out the podium and Red Bull sees both cars not reaching the finish line. As Alonso would say: “Where is Palmer?”",16,1662224410

inipghb,:red-bull: Red Bull,"I don't think they should let current F1 drivers run F2, but I think they should let the reserve drivers, former F1 drivers, and past F2 champs not in F1 also run in F2.  The main reason is just that there is no good alternative for open-seater driving in Europe that is anywhere close to F1 once you are no longer eligible for F2.  And having participants like the reserve drivers would generate a lot more interest in F2, because then you would generate more story lines around ""should (reserve driver)'s dominant campaign in F2 push (current driver) out of a seat?""  And sure, most of the time that wouldn't be the case, but sometimes you have drivers who peak late and sometimes you have drivers who peak early -- keeping them around close to F1 but also running fast ICE open seaters would be a good thing.

The way F2 and F3 are treated now is more like they are soccer ""academy"" programs with age limits, but to me, at least F2 should be treated more like a full-on 2nd-division soccer league, where you have a mix of prospects and veterans, most everyone trying to work their way up to the top division.",26,1662593191
